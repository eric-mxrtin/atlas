With 40+ libraries and countless study spaces scattered across UofT, finding the perfect spot can feel like a scavenger hunt. So, I created atlas. It includes:

<ul>
  <li> 🔍 Live data on building availability, user ratings, and TTC connections (powered by Google Maps API) </li>
  <li> ⚙️ Custom sorting and filtering for a seamless user experience </li>
  <li> 🚀 Fly-to-place map navigation for intuitive exploration </li>
  <li> 💻 Built with: React, Node/Express, Mapbox, Google Maps API, and Vercel</li>
</ul>


🙏 Special thanks to Akshar Barot for inspiring this project with Spots and letting me tailor it towards UofT.
